# Introduction

Many melanoma observational studies have been carried out across different countries and geographic
areas using heterogeneous assessments of epidemiologic risk factors and clinical variables.  
The aim is to develop a consensus questionnaire to standardize epidemiologic and clinical data collection for melanoma risk
assessment.  
[**Melanoq**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30098061) is the product of the work of the MelanoStrum Consortium.

This project's goal is to implement a digital version of the aforementioned questionnaire by providing a way to *compile* the questionnaire itself and to expose the physicians, researchers and authorized personnel a way to *query* the data stored in the questionnaires' database.
